# :zap: Quick Start Guide

Here’s how to get started with Vue PDF Viewer in your Vue 3 or Nuxt 3 project:

## 1. Check Prerequsities

Here are the basic system requirements to run the Vue PDF Viewer component:

- Vue version: >= 3.0
- Nuxt version: >= 3.0

_Remark:_

- _Vite version will affect the Vue or Nuxt version used._
- _If using TypeScript, it requires >= TypeScript 4.6._

### Browser support

| Chrome | Firefox | Edge | Safari | Safari iOS | Chrome Android |
| ------ | ------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- | -------------- |
| 115+   | 115+    | 115+ | 16.5+  | 16.5+      | 126+           |

## 2. Install the Package

Use your preferred package manager to install the Vue PDF Viewer package:

### Using bun:

```bash
bun add @vue-pdf-viewer/viewer
```

### Using npm:

```bash
npm install @vue-pdf-viewer/viewer
```

### Using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @vue-pdf-viewer/viewer
```

### Using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install @vue-pdf-viewer/viewer
```

Vue PDF Viewer uses APIs from pdf.js and pnpm command will attempt to update the version of pdfjs-dist that may be higher than the default version in the Vue PDF Viewer library. You might encounter an error, such as:

```bash
UnknownErrorException: The API version "4.4.168" does not match the Worker version "4.0.269".
```

To avoid version mismatch, please add pnpm.overrides to your package.json to specify the exact version of pdfjs-dist:

```json
"pnpm": {
  "overrides": {
    "pdfjs-dist": "4.4.168"
  }
}
```

After that, you can install Vue PDF Viewer via pnpm command

```bash
pnpm add @vue-pdf-viewer/viewer
```

For more information on how to use different package managers, please visit our [installation guide](https://docs.vue-pdf-viewer.dev/introduction/getting-started.html#installation?utm_source=npmjs).

## 3. Import and Use the Component

To initiate Vue PDF Viewer, you will first need to import VPdfViewer component.

There are two main ways to use Vue PDF Viewer in your project, namely:

- **Composition API**: A new method to organize and reuse logic by allowing developers to write components as functions.
- **Options API**: A traditional method from Vue 2 where components are grouped into series of options.

### Composition API:

```vue
<script setup>
import { VPdfViewer } from '@vue-pdf-viewer/viewer'
</script>
<template>
  <div :style="{ width: '1028px', height: '700px' }">
    <VPdfViewer
      src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/pdf.js/ba2edeae/web/compressed.tracemonkey-pldi-09.pdf"
    />
  </div>
</template>
```

### Options API:

```vue
<script>
import { VPdfViewer } from '@vue-pdf-viewer/viewer'

export default {
  components: { VPdfViewer },
  data() {
    return {
      src: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/pdf.js/ba2edeae/web/compressed.tracemonkey-pldi-09.pdf'
    }
  }
}
</script>
<template>
  <VPdfViewer :src="src" />
</template>
```
